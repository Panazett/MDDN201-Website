					<h2>Found Around Wellington</h2>
					<p>Internet related hardware, and applications that utilize this hardware can be found scattered around Wellington</p>
					<div class="type">
						<h3>Hardware</h3>
						<p>The main components of internet hardware would include items such as routers and antennas</p>
					</div>
					<div class="type">
						<h3>Applications</h3>
						<p>Applications that use the network would include items such as security systems and parking meters</p>
					</div>

					<h2>Hardware</h2>
					<div class="example">
						<h3>Ethernet Cables</h3>
						<img src="images/examples/1.jpg">

					</div>
					<div class="example">
						<h3>Ethernet Port</h3>
						<img src="images/examples/9.jpg">
						<p>Ethernet ports are the end points between a connection between two connected devices by the means of an ethernet cable.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="example">
						<h3>Phone Line</h3>
						<img src="images/examples/8.jpg">

					</div>
					<div class="example">
						<h3>Wireless Transimitters</h3>
						<img src="images/examples/14.jpg">
						<p>Wireless transmitters are used to broadcast wireless frequencies, allowing devices to access the internet.</p>
					</div>

					<h2>Applications</h2>
					<div class="example">
						<h3>Security Systems</h3>
						<img src="images/examples/13.jpg">
						<p>Security systems take advantage of local networks ability to communicate, allowing communication between multiple security orientated devices.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="example">
						<h3>Security Cameras</h3>
						<img src="images/examples/2.jpg">
						<p>Security cameras use networks to transfer recorded data and imagery to devices capable of mass storage.</p>
